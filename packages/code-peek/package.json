  "readme": "# Code Peek\n\nThis package allows you to quickly peek and edit functions contained in other\nfiles instead of having to open the file separately. This was inspired by\n[Brackets](http://brackets.io/)' quick edit feature and Maushundb's [Quick Editor](https://atom.io/packages/quick-editor) for CSS/LESS/SCSS.\n\n![Code Peek Demo](https://github.com/DFreds/code-peek-atom/blob/master/code-peek.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Full change log [here](./CHANGELOG.md).\n\n# Supported Files\nCurrently, supported files include:\n* JavaScript\n* ES6\n* [TypeScript/TypeScriptReact](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) (Supports classes and interfaces as well!)\n* Go\n* JSX\n* PHP\n* Java\n* C#\n* Python\n* Coffee\n* Ruby\n\n## Adding A Language\nIf you'd like to add your own language, send me a regex string or make a pull request that adds one that will correctly find the first line of a function using a known name for that language in all cases. Currently, Code Peek supports languages that use curly brackets to indicate the start and end of a function as well as tab based languages such as Python.\n\nThe regular expressions for the supported files are located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFreds/code-peek-atom/master/lib/supported-files.coffee).\n\n# Installation\n```\napm install code-peek\n```\nOr search for <code>code-peek</code> in the Atom settings view.\n\n# Configuration\n\n### Ask If Save On Modified\nBy default, clicking the \"Close without saving\" button after a file is modified using Code Peek will ask the user if they want to save their changes. This configuration option can be toggled off to stop the dialogue box from appearing.\n\n### Ignored Paths\nThis setting provides a way to exclude certain paths or files from being found by Code Peek. Please note that any files or directories in 'Core -> Ignored Names' will be ignored even if you do not list it here. Additionally, any files and directories ignored by the current project's VCS system will be ignored if the 'Core -> Exclude VCS Ignored Paths' is checked. See the description of that setting for more details.\n\n### Code Peek Location\nThis setting dictates where the Code Peek panel should appear. By default, it will appear at the bottom of the screen. Additional options include top, left, right, header, footer, and modal.\n\n### Max Height\nBy default, the maximum height of the Code Peek panel is 300px. This configuration option can be set to change the height, and supports a range from 200px to 800px. This only affects panels where the location is top, bottom, header, footer, or modal.\n\n### Max Width\nBy default, the maximum width of the Code Peek panel is 500px. This configuration option can be set to change the width, and supports a range from 200px to 1000px. This only affects panels where the location is left or right.\n\n# Key Bindings\nThe default <code>cmd-alt-e</code> or <code>ctrl-alt-e</code> will toggle code-peek while the cursor is over a function of a supported type.\n\nThis can be edited by defining key bindings as shown below.\n\n```coffee\n'.platform-darwin atom-text-editor':\n  'cmd-alt-e': 'code-peek:peekFunction'\n  'shift-escape': 'code-peek:toggleCodePeekOff'\n\n'.platform-linux atom-text-editor, .platform-win32 atom-text-editor':\n  'ctrl-alt-e': 'code-peek:peekFunction'\n  'shift-escape': 'code-peek:toggleCodePeekOff'\n```\n\n# Other Projects\n## Test Navigator\nI created [Test Navigator](https://atom.io/packages/test-navigator) to allow you to quickly navigate between implementation and test files. Check it out!\n",
