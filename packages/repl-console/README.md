# REPL Console

Run REPL code directly in ATOM. Output is displayed in Dev Tools console.

Supported Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go, Shell Script and JSON

Runtime must be available in system PATH for code to execute in that particular language. JavaScript (and JSON) is the only exception as it runs natively in ATOM.
